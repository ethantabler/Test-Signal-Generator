# Test-Signal-Generator
Inspired by Practical Electronics' article in their June 2021 edition, this project is a device that outputs a steady, audible sine wave for testing audio equipment.

In addition to the basic funtionality of being battery powered and having an adjustable output level, I'm also designing for a tunable frequency within a small range.
